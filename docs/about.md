Hi, I'm Manuel Abascal, a self-taught software engineer based in Montreal, Canada. I'm passionated about Front End Web Development, Javascript, automation & solving problems in general. Welcome to my blog! This is my own, tiny space on the internet, where I document my professional journey in software development & hopefully help some peers, by sharing what I have learned, along the way! Feel free to reach to me on LinkedIn or check my GitHub to contribute & collaborate with me!
