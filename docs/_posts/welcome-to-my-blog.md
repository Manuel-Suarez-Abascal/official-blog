# Finally decided to launch my blog

Welcome to my blog & my first post! For a long time, I wanted to launch my personal blog but I couldn't find the time to do so. After 3 years working as a Software Engineer, I have finally decided it was time to roll up my sleeves & launch my blog! 

It wasn't an easy decision. For instance, I spent a lot of time deciding on which platform I was going to build my blog. Should I use WordPress or a static site generator? I choose the latter. 

## WordPress vs Static Site Generators

Although [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) is the most used & popular platform for bloggers( more than 35% of the web is powered by WordPress) & have many advantages such as:

- easy to configure & change how your website looks due to the huge, existing pool of free & [paid, available themes](https://themeforest.net/category/wordpress).
- a long list of plugins that allow you to extend the functionality of your website.
- huge community support & resources. 
- fast development time thanks to plugins & themes.

Still, I felt WordPress was not a good option for me due to its slow rendering( due to not optimized plugins & themes...WordPress is actually quite fast) & plus I was looking for an alternative for which I didn't have to pay for hosting. Hence, enter static site generators!

## Choosing a static site generator

After doing a [quick research](https://strapi.io/blog/top-10-static-site-generators-in-2020),I narrowed down my options to a [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) based static site generator such as [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/), [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) & [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/). I chose the Vue.js ecosystem because:

- It's my favorite modern JavaScript framework.
- I have a ton of experience working professionally with it. 

I felt Nuxt.js was designed primarily to build Vue.js applications & I need to do a lot of workarounds to turn it into a blog. Gridsome was overkill because I didn't need to use [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) or get any data from an API or CMS. So finally, after reading the VuePress's documentation, I realized it was my best option.

## VuePress static site generator

VuePress is a minimalistic Vue-powered static site generator & offers many features, in particular:

- allows you to create, configure & extend custom themes from scratch.
- enables you to write Vue markdown files.
- offers multi-language support.
- let you extend functionality through its plugin system like a newsletter, a comment section, etc...
- no need for a database or pay for hosting due to the nature of static content.

I was sold for it. It only took me 2-3 hours to have the first iteration on my blog running with it! I was really pleased with the results. As my knowledge & experience increase(and let's be honest having more time as well), I'm planning to add a newsletter, a dark theme & (maybe) a comment section feature. 

So now that I explained in detail my platform of choice for my blog, I am sure you might be asking yourself: "What topics are you going to blog about?" That's a great question, dear reader! I expect to focus on topics mostly related to JavaScript, Vue.js, SPA development & automation! But I probably will cover other topics that might discover & I might start developing a strong interest in it.

I hope you join me on my journey & learn something along the way!
